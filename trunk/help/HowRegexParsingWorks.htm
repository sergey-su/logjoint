		<h2>How LogJoint parses text files</h2>
		<div>
			<h3>Log as string</h3>
			<p>
				LogJoint considers a textual log file as a single string. This is a logical representation,
				of-course physically LogJoint doesn't load the whole file into a string in memory. 
				A string here means a sequence of Unicode characters. To convert a raw log file 
				to Unicode characters LogJoint uses the encoding specified in your format's settings.
			</p>
			<p>
				Suppose we have this log file:
			</p>
			<pre class="code">
i 2010/3/1 13:30:23 Msg 1
w 2010/3/1 13:30:24 Msg 2</pre>
			<p>
			It contains two messages, one message per line. Each line starts with severity mark 
			(i - information, w - warning). It is followed by date and time stamp. The rest of a message
			is some text with no fixed structure.
			</p>
			<p>
			The log would be represented by the following string. 
			</p>
			<p>

			</p>
			<p>
			Symbol <img src="images\newline.png" /> represents newline character.</p>
			
			<h3>Header regular expression</h3>
			LogJoint uses regular expressions to find and parse 
			messages in the string. The first and the most important one
			is <b>header regular expression</b>. It is supposed to
			match the beginnings (or headers) of messages. LogJoints takes 
			advantage of the fact that log messages usually have well recognizable 
			or even fixed headers. In our example the header of a message 
			is severity mark followed by the date/time information. Each message 
			starts at new line.
			The header regular expression may look like this:
			<pre class="code">
^             # every message starts from new line
(?&lt;sev&gt;       # begin of capture
  [i|w|e]     # severity mark
)             # end of capture
\s            # space between severity mark and date/time
(?&lt;date&gt;      # begin of capture
  \d{4}       # 4-digit year
  \/          # slash separating year and month
  \d{1,2}     # one or two digits representing month
  \/          # slash separating month and day
  \d{1,2}     # one or two digits representing the day
  \s          # space between date and time
  \d{2}       # two-digit hour
  \:          # time separator
  \d{2}       # two-digit minutes
  \:          # time separator
  \d{2}       # two-digit seconds
)             # end of capture
</pre>
			<p>
			Note that LogJoint ignores unescaped white space in patterns and treats everything after # as a comment. 
			This regex captures two named values: <b>sev</b> - the severity of the message 
			and <b>date</b> - date/time information. 
			The need for these captures will be described later.
			^ at the beginning of the regex matches the beginning of any line in the source string,
			not just the beginning of the entire string. 
			Programmers can read about IgnorePatternWhitespace, ExplicitCapture, and Multiline flags that are actually used here in msdn: 
			<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.text.regularexpressions.regexoptions.aspx">RegexOptions Enumeration</a>.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			LogJoint applies the header regular expression many times to find all the messages in the input string.
			In our example the header regex will match two times and will yield two sets of captures:
			<img src="images/regex_parsing_header_re.PNG"/>
			</p>
			
			<p>
			Thick black lines show message boundaries. After applying header regex LogJoint knows where 
			the messages begin and where they end. A messsage ends where the next message begins.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Body regular expression</h3>
			<p>
			The next step LogJoint makes is parsing the content of the message. LogJoint uses 
			<b>body regular expression</b> for that. Body regex is supposed to parse (break down to
			the captures) the part of the message that follows the header. In our example
			the body regex will be applied for these substrings:
			<img src="images/regex_parsing_body_re1.png" />
			</p>
			
			<p>
			In the example the actual message content doesn't have any structure. 
			Because of that there is no special fields that we want to parse by body regex.
			The body regular expression would look like this:
			</p>
			<pre class="code">
^              # align to the beginng of the message's body (i.e. to the end of the header)
(?&lt;body&gt;        # begin a capture
  .*           # match everything without any parsing
)              # end a capture
$              # align to the end of body (i.e. to the beginning of next message)</pre>
			
			<p>
			This regex captures all the input substring to the capture named <b>body</b>.
			The need in capturing is explained below.
            Actually body regex as it was specified above can be omitted altogether - LogJoint assumes it by default.
			It is important that in body regular expression's the meaning of ^ and $ is different 
			from header regexps.
			Here they match the beginning and the end of the entire body substring. 
			You can read more in msdn: Singleline regex option 
			(<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.text.regularexpressions.regexoptions.aspx">RegexOptions</a>).
			
			</p>
		
			<h3>Fields mapping</h3>
			<p>
			Summarizing what has been said: LogJoint uses regular expressions to divide up
			the input string into separate messages and to get the set of named substrings (captures)
			for each message. The final step is to map this set of substrings to 
			the fields that LogJoint will use to construct message object.
			There are predefined fields that are recognized and handled by LogJoint special way.
			There might be user-defined fields as well.
			</p>
			<p>Here is the table of predefined fields:</p>
			<table>
				<tr>
					<th>Field name</th>
					<th>Type</th>
					<th>Description</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Time</td>
					<td>DateTime</td>
					<td>Defines the timestamp of log message. This field is important for LogJoint to 
					correlate messages from different sources and to allow timeline navigation functionality.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Thread</td>
					<td>String</td>
					<td>Defines the thread identifier of the message. All the messages of the same thread will have the same backgound color.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Severity</td>
					<td>Severity</td>
					<td>Defines the severity of the message. Severity might be <i>Severity.Information</i>, <i>Severity.Warning</i> or <i>Severity.Error</i>.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Body</td>
					<td>string</td>
					<td>Actual content of the message, its text content.</td>
				</tr>
<!--
				<tr>
					<td>EntryType</td>
					<td>EntryType</td>
					<td>Defines the type of a message. Possible values are 
						<i>EntryType.Content</i> - regular text message, 
						<i>EntryType.FrameBegin</i> - the begin of a frame,
						<i>EntryType.FrameEnd</i> - the end of a frame. 
						FrameBegin/FrameEnd define the boundaries of frames.
						Frames might be collapsed later by the user.
					</td>
				</tr>
-->
			</table>
			
			<p>Any field with name different from the names in the table above are user-defined.
			They are automatically appended to <b>Body</b> field using 
			"field name"="field value" format.</p>
			
			<p>
			Don't confuse regex captures and message fields. The captures are raw strings
			that are cut out of the log. Message fields are strongly typed, they define
			the message object that LogJoint works with. When you define a new format
			you need to provide the way to map the input captures to output fields.
			This mapping is called <b>fields mapping</b>. Basically it is a table
			that contains formulas for each output field. Formulas are expressions
			or pieces of C# code. Formulas use language expressions or function 
			calls to convert regex captures (that are strings) to strongly typed
			output fields. Internally LogJoint takes the formulas you provided
			and generates a temporary class. 
			This class is used then in the parsing pipeline.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			Here is example:
			</p>
			<table>
				<tr>
					<th>Field</th>
					<th>Formula type</th>
					<th>Formula</th>
					<th>Comments</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Time</td>
					<td>Expression</td>
					<td><pre>TO_DATETIME(date, "yyyy/M/d HH:mm:ss")</pre></td>
					<td>
					This formula is an expression. It calls predefined function TO_DATETIME()
					passing <b>date</b> capture as a parameter. The names of all regexp captures
					are available in the context of the expression. They have string type. 
					TO_DATETIME() returns the value of type DateTime. Expressions must evaluate 
					to the type that is compatible with field's type. 
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Body</td>
					<td>Expression</td>
					<td><pre>body</pre></td>
					<td>
					This formula is simple: it just returns <b>body</b> capture. 
					Remind you: <b>Body</b> field has String type and so does <b>body</b> capture.
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Severity</td>
					<td>Function</td>
					<td>
<pre>
switch (sev)
{
case "w":
  return Severity.Warning;
case "e":
  return Severity.Error;
default:
  return Severity.Info;
}
</pre></td>
					<td>
					This formula is a function. The difference between expressions and functions
					is that the function may contain any sequence of statements and must return 
					a value (<b>return</b> statement). Expressions may contain only one expression,
					no statements. Expressions are shorter and simplier but thay are somewhat limited.
					In formulas of type <b>Function</b> you are free to implement any business logic.
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
			
			<p>
			All fields except <b>Time</b> are optional. If you don't provide a formula for 
			<b>Thread</b> field LogJoint will consider all messages to have the same thread.
			The default severity is <b>Info</b>. 
<!--           The default <b>EntryType</b> is <b>EntryType.Content</b>.-->
			</p>
			
			<h3>Summary</h3>
			<p>Here is the picture of overall parsing pipeline:</p>
			<img src="images/regex_parsing_overall.PNG" />
			<ul>
				<li>1. The log is loaded into a string in memory.</li>
				<li>2. The string is divided into separate messages and the list of captures is created for each message. 
					<b>Head regular expression</b> and <b>body regular expression</b> are used to accomplish that.</li>
				<li>3. <b>Fields mapping</b> is used to convert string-based captures to a set of stronly types fields.</li>
				<li>4. The fields get converted to an object that LogJoint uses to display the message in the view.</li>
			</ul>
